See github page for all features that must be made.
Also, for further documentation, we may need to break up the markdown files in to smaller files inside folders.

Currently, I am working on fleshing out supa-int. The documentation for Edge functions, Secrets and Webhooks may need to be fixed. We need better bucket support, too. We also need support for edge functions, secrets, and webhooks. This is for API and Stripe integration for now.

Then, I will be exploring how we can easily optimize design, potentially by integrating the Lovable stack. We will then add all the fancy support for Lovable's extra tools later, but we will take inspiration from their prompts. I must continue to reverse engineer lovable and learn their wrapper to increase the quality of design in our code.

After this, we will make a step by step guide on how Supabase was integrated and do the same for Stripe.




Then, I will be working on improving prompting to be able to integrate APIs with instructions, docs and eventually, context7 and perplexity. Before I do anything large, I will test setting up prompting and knowledge for an OpenAI integration using secrets on Supabase.

- Support for multiple LLM providers with an extensible architecture
- In-browser development environment using WebContainer technology
- Integrated terminal for executing commands
- Version control and code history
- Project export capabilities (ZIP, GitHub)
- Deployment capabilities to platforms like Netlify
- File system management

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript
- **Framework**: Remix (with Vite)
- **UI**: Tailwind CSS, Radix UI components, Headless UI
- **Editor**: CodeMirror for code editing
- **Terminal**: XTerm.js for terminal emulation
- **Containerization**: WebContainer API for in-browser NodeJS runtime
- **State Management**: Zustand and Nanostores
- **Styling**: UnoCSS
- **Build Tools**: Vite, TypeScript
- **Deployment**: CloudFlare Pages, with additional integrations for Netlify, Vercel, etc.
- **Electron**: For desktop application functionality

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **LLM Integration**
   - Located in `app/lib/modules/llm` and `app/lib/.server/llm`
   - Implements a provider-based system for various AI models
   - Each provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) has its own implementation
   - Manages API key storage and usage

2. **WebContainer**
   - Located in `app/lib/webcontainer`
   - Provides in-browser NodeJS runtime environment
   - Enables file system operations, terminal commands, and preview capabilities

3. **File System**
   - Manages virtual file system through WebContainer
   - Handles file operations (create, read, update, delete)
   - Implements file locking mechanisms to prevent conflicts

4. **UI Components**
   - Extensive component library in `app/components`
   - Uses Radix UI and Headless UI for accessible UI elements
   - Implements custom CodeMirror integration for code editing

5. **Routing**
   - Uses Remix for routing
   - API routes for backend functionality in `app/routes/api.*`
   - Main application routes in `app/routes/*`

6. **State Management**
   - Uses Zustand and Nanostores for global state
   - State is organized by feature in `app/lib/stores`

### Development Workflow

The application follows a typical Remix + React application architecture with server-side and client-side components. The key unique aspects are:

1. **AI Integration**: The LLM Manager orchestrates different providers and models
2. **WebContainer**: Provides NodeJS runtime in the browser
3. **Project Management**: Handles project creation, editing, and deployment

## Code Style and Patterns

1. **TypeScript Usage**
   - Strong typing throughout the codebase
   - Extensive use of interfaces and type definitions
   - TypeScript configuration in `tsconfig.json`

2. **Component Organization**
   - Component-based architecture
   - Reusable components with clear interfaces
   - Separation of concerns between UI and logic

3. **Module Structure**
   - Clear separation of client and server code
   - Modular organization by feature
   - Utilities and common functions in dedicated directories

4. **Error Handling**
   - Structured error reporting system
   - Preview error forwarding
   - Console logging with severity levels

5. **API Design**
   - RESTful API endpoints
   - Clean separation of concerns
   - Streaming responses for real-time updates from AI models

## Future Development

The rootacc3ss fork is actively developing several new features:
- FULL Supabase integration
- FULL Stripe support
- Enhanced rules system
- Memory system for context management
- Better codebase context understanding
- Perplexity API integration
- Improved error handling
- Better commenting throughout code
- Enhanced logging and alerting
- GitHub synchronization improvements
- Project planning module with Claude Task Master

## Extensibility

The codebase is designed to be extensible, particularly in:
1. **LLM Providers**: New AI models can be added with minimal code
2. **UI Components**: Modular design allows for component replacement
3. **Deployment Targets**: New deployment targets can be integrated
